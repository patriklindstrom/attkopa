A web app to communicate between familuy members what groceries to buy made in Meteor on nodejs. 
It is a test to develop with Meteor on a VM linux machine on nitreous.
It is based on the meteor tutorial on https://www.meteor.com/try 
It is written in javascript ( that is like the thing with Meteor). I am adding a responsive design and dates. 
On purpose I do not add the login because that would make it less likely for my family members to use it :-)
